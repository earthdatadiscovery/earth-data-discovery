## PROJECT

This repository is part of a project created by the [Earth Data Discovery Team](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/connect/data-discovery-earth-science/teams/edd/members) for the [2020 Space Apps Challenge](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org).

### The Challenge

Our team decided to address the [Data Discovery for Earth Science](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/connect/data-discovery-earth-science/details) Challenge":

> This challenge will ask you to devise a tool or technique to guide users to relevant datasets to study specific events.

The goal of our project is to make Earth Science Data easily accessible for everyone. 
We think that finding a database for any project should be a simple, fast and straight forward process, that doesn't require lots of expertise or previous knowledge.
In order to reach this goal, we provide a search and visualization interface, providing information about publicly available databases from the main Space Agencies over the world.

Our main goals:

- Provide an instant, relevant and typo tolerant search engine for Earth Science datasets.
- Provide an intuitive, simple yet rich interface for finding the dataset that fit your needs.

<h1 align="center">ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY</h1>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
